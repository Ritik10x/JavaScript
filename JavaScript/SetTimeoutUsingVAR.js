function x()
{
    for ( var i=1; i<=5;i++) // here we use  var 
    {
       function close(x) // created a function named close and its variable x 
       {// the for loop iteratuion will go one by one from this function
        setTimeout(function ()
        {
            console.log(x);
        }, x*1000);
       }
       close(i)
    }
    console.log("Hello World");
    }
    x();
    /*
    What Happens When the Code Runs
The function x starts executing, and the loop begins.
For each value of i from 1 to 5, the close function is called with i.
Each call to close sets up a setTimeout to log the value of i (as x) after a delay.
The delays are 1 second, 2 seconds, 3 seconds, 4 seconds, and 5 seconds for values 1 to 5, respectively.
"Hello World" is printed immediately.

Why It Works This Way
Immediate Execution: "Hello World" is printed right away because it is outside any delay.
Capturing Values with a Function: The function close creates a new scope for each value of i, capturing its current value. This prevents the issue we saw earlier with var and setTimeout.
Delay Calculation: Each value of i is printed after i seconds due to the multiplication x * 1000 in setTimeout.



Sure! Let's break down the code step by step in a simple way.

Code Explanation
Here's the code we are looking at:


What the Code Does
Function Definition:

A function named x is defined.
For Loop:

Inside the function x, there is a for loop that starts with i equal to 1 and runs as long as i is less than or equal to 5.
After each loop, i is increased by 1 (i++).
Inner Function close:

Inside the loop, a function named close is defined, which takes a parameter x.
The close function uses setTimeout to log the value of x after a delay.
setTimeout:

setTimeout is used to schedule the logging of x after x * 1000 milliseconds (1 second per value of x).
This means that the delay increases with each iteration (1 second for 1, 2 seconds for 2, etc.).
Calling the close Function:

The close function is called with the current value of i, so it captures i in its own scope.
Console Log Statement:

"Hello World" is immediately printed to the console after setting up all the timeouts.
Calling the Function:

The function x is called, which triggers everything to run.
What Happens When the Code Runs
The function x starts executing, and the loop begins.
For each value of i from 1 to 5, the close function is called with i.
Each call to close sets up a setTimeout to log the value of i (as x) after a delay.
The delays are 1 second, 2 seconds, 3 seconds, 4 seconds, and 5 seconds for values 1 to 5, respectively.
"Hello World" is printed immediately.
Output
The output will be:

Copy code
Hello World
1
2
3
4
5
Why It Works This Way
Immediate Execution: "Hello World" is printed right away because it is outside any delay.
Capturing Values with a Function: The function close creates a new scope for each value of i, capturing its current value. This prevents the issue we saw earlier with var and setTimeout.
Delay Calculation: Each value of i is printed after i seconds due to the multiplication x * 1000 in setTimeout.
Summary
This code uses a combination of a loop and an inner function to schedule console logs at increasing delays. The use of the close function ensures that each setTimeout captures the current value of i correctly, resulting in the numbers 1 to 5 being printed after their respective delays.
